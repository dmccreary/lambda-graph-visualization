## Alonzo Church and the Legacy of Lambda Calculus

![](./alanzo-church/cover.png){width=200}

 This story chronicles the remarkable journey of a brilliant mathematician whose abstract theoretical work in the 1930s would eventually revolutionize modern computing. Through twelve vivid panels, this graphic novel follows Alonzo Church from his early struggles with mathematical foundations at Princeton University to his groundbreaking creation of lambda calculus—a elegant system for expressing computation through functions. 
 
 The story captures Church's initial frustration as audiences of mathematicians and early computer scientists failed to grasp the practical significance of his abstract lambda expressions, and shows how he overcame these communication challenges by developing simpler explanations and finding unexpected connections to emerging computer science. 
 
 Using a bright, tech-forward artistic style, the narrative traces lambda calculus from its theoretical origins through its eventual implementation in early programming languages like LISP, to its ubiquitous presence in today's functional programming languages, cloud computing platforms, artificial intelligence systems, and web development frameworks. This engaging visual story demonstrates how pure mathematical research can take decades to find its practical applications, ultimately becoming the hidden foundation of our digital world—making it an inspiring introduction for students learning about the deep connections between mathematical theory and computational practice.
