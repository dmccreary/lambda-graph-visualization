**Visualizing Functional Computation with Interactive Graph Data Structures**

A comprehensive educational resource for learning Lambda Calculus through interactive visualizations and animated graph transformations. This project uses MicroSims (micro-simulations) to help students understand lambda expressions, β-reduction, and functional computation through visual graph representations.

## 📚 Overview

Lambda Graph Visualization is an interactive educational tool designed for upper-level undergraduates and graduate students studying functional programming, lambda calculus, and graph theory. The project transforms abstract lambda expressions into visual graph structures, making complex functional programming concepts accessible through animation and interaction.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Step-by-step animation of lambda expression evaluation
- **Graph-Based Representation**: Visual mapping of lambda terms to graph structures
- **Educational MicroSims**: Bite-sized interactive simulations for learning
- **Comprehensive Course Content**: Complete curriculum with chapters, exercises, and projects
- **p5.js Integration**: Browser-based visualizations using modern web technologies
